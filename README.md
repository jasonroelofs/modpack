GTCE / Gregicality modpack
--------------------------

The aim of this modpack is two fold: explore Gregicality and to provide an introduction
to GregTech Community Edition for those who haven't experienced it before.

However, I really don't like the early game, so I'm just skipping Steam entirely and making
AE2 available very early (MV, basically). Manually batch crafting items is not fun or interesting
and makes it very hard for many people to really get to experience GTCE, so lets get
autocrafting in place as soon as possible while still teaching people about the pack.
